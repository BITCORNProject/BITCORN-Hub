!! no i would just want one - right now, i manually reward people who redeem 100,000 channel points for 1,000 BITCORN, by $tipcorn each person that redeems. i need this to happen automatically like your redeem works

!! things i would want for MTTV: a. text to speech like this for auth/vip+ users, b. auto redemption for corn, c. youtube popup for authorized vip+ users, d. voice to text scroll on bottom - whatever is easiest for this
