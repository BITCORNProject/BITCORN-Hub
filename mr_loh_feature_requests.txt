!! no i would just want one - right now, i manually reward people who redeem 100,000 channel points for 1,000 BITCORN, by $tipcorn each person that redeems. i need this to happen automatically like your redeem works

!! things i would want for MTTV: a. text to speech like this for auth/vip+ users, b. auto redemption for corn, c. youtube popup for authorized vip+ users, d. voice to text scroll on bottom - whatever is easiest for this


MR_LOH_: someone redeemed 100k in my channel now (1:1 ratio). Did not see any wallet-update/balance-change. will check in a few min

MR_LOH_: ok, channelpoints not refunded to the dude that did the 100k redeem (cryptodan) and I don't see the 100k corn deducted from my streamer balance. No rush, just wanted to give feedback

MR_LOH_: I will disable the feature for now, so people don't lose their points

6MR_LOH_: atlantiades1 tried now. channelpoints got insta-refunded
4:36MR_LOH_: I can tipcorn him

MR_LOH_: so cryptodan1 was synced too. so some error with the auto-payment then I guess. but the refund worked this time at least

Steini20021: !tts can we make a feature so let's say i'm a streamer and i DISABLE transactions... THE BOT would say that to chat

Steini20021: so let's say a streamer DISABLES rain or something




caLLow: +add message for unsrgister users to register for channel points
-----   +and if tipped and broadcaster has send chat messages off
-----   +(works as is I didn't fix anything) if user unchecks the streamer the bot should leave the channel
