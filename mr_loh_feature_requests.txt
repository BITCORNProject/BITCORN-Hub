Here are some feature requests:
idle-rewards channel-owner
custom sub-rewards
channelpoints -> bitcorn auto-payout(redeem)


 u have the watch file function there, instead of doing that u have request going every 2 minutes asking for the channels

if the result is not http 200, dont do anything

the endpoint returns a string array of the channels to join
